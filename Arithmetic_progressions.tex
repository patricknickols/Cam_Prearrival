An arithmetic progression has third term $\alpha$ and ninth term $\beta$. Find the sum to thirty terms. 
\newline
If the first term is $u$ and the common difference is $d$, then we have
\[
\alpha = u + 2d
\]
\[
\beta = u + 8d
\]
and the sum of the overall series is 
\[
15(2u + 29d) = 30u + 435d.
\]
We thus wish to write 
\[
a\alpha + b\beta = 30u + 435d.
\]
Expanding gives
\[
(a+b)u + (2a + 8b)d = 30 u + 435d. 
\]
We thus have a two variable system of equations:
\[
a+b = 30.
\]
\[
2a + 8b = 435.
\]
So
\[
b = \frac{125}{2}
\]
and
\[
a = \frac{-65}{2}.
\]
So we have that $\Sigma = -32.5 \alpha + 62.5 \beta$.
