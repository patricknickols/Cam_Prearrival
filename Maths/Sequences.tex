If $a_{n+1} = 3a_n + 4$ and $a_1 = 1$ then deduce a formula for $a_n$ for any $n \geq 1$. Use mathematical induction to prove your result.
\newline
Computing a few values gives
\[
a_2 = 7
\]
\[
a_3 = 25
\]
\[
a_4 = 79
\]
It looks like $a_n = 3^n - 2$. Hence let $P(n)$ be the statement that $a_n = 3^n -2$. $P_1$ is true since $a_1 = 1 = 3^1 - 2.$ Now assume $P(k)$ is true for some natural $k$. Now consider $P(k+1)$. 
\[
a_{k+1} = 3(a_k) + 4
\]
but since $P(k)$ has been assumed to be true that means
\[
a_{k+1} = 3(3^k -2)+4 = 3^{k+1} - 6 + 4 = 3^{k+1} -2.
\]
Hence $P(k+1)$ is also true. Since $P(k)$ implies $P(k+1)$ and since $P(1)$ is true, by mathematical induction, $P(n)$ is true for all natural $n \geq 1$.
