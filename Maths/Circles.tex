Find, for a sector of angle $\dfrac{\pi}{3}$ radians of a disc of radius 3:
\begin{enumerate}
\item the length of the permiter; and \item the area.
\end{enumerate}
\begin{enumerate}
\item
Since the sector has as an angle of $\frac{\pi}{3}$ it is a sixth of the circle. Consequently its arc length is
\[
\frac{1}{6}2\pi\times 3 = \pi.
\]
In addition, it has two sides that are radii and so have lengths of 3 each. Hence the perimter is $6 + \pi$.
\item 
Again, the area is a sixth and so is equal to
\[
\frac{1}{6}\times 9 \pi = \frac{3}{2}\pi \text{ units squared}.
\]
\end{enumerate}
